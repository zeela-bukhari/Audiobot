  utter_global_answer:
  - text: Global warming is the temperature of Earth's surface, oceans and atmosphere
      going up over tens of years. ... The most noticeable changes because of this
      increase in temperature is the melting of ice caps all around the world. Sea
      level is rising steadily because of continental ice melting into the sea.
  - text: The greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's
      atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature above what it would be
      without this atmosphere.
  - text: Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants
      and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar
      radiation that have bounced off the earthâ€™s surface.
  - text: Global warming are being felt across the globe. Extreme heat waves have
      caused tens of thousands of deaths around the world in recent years.

  utter_like_weather:
  - text: Well, the weather is an important part of nature as well as, everyone likes
      and dislikes the weather according to their choice and needs but, I always prefer
      to hot weather because that time I enjoy a lot as well, I also go outside with
      friends and family.
  - text: My favorite season is spring It is a time when trees grow new leaves and
      flowers of nature. There is greenery all around. Due to global warming summers
      are very hot in Pakistan and it is very difficult for the people to bear the
      second heat of the Sun.

  utter_weather_debate:
  - text: Yes you can debate on weather. This is a discussable topic.
  - text: Weather is good for small talk.You can talk about 1) climate 2) weather
      seasons 3)Weather Fruits 4)Weather Forecasting etc
  utter_weather_forecast:
  - text: A seven-day forecast can accurately predict the weather about 80 percent
      of the time and a five-day forecast can accurately predict the weather approximately
      90 percent of the time. ... Meteorologists use computer programs called weather
      models to make forecasts.
  - text: Meteorologists can give a pretty decent idea of what the weather will be
      like about a week in advance but as far as really accurate, they get accurate
      about 24-48 hours out.
  utter_weather_influence:
  - text: If you're in a good mood, chances are, bad weather won't bring you down
      too much. But if you're feeling crummy already, a cold, dreary day could easily
      make your mood go from bad to worse.
  - text: every time you go out and take photos of clouds that strike you as interesting,
      make conscious note of your local weather patterns, or go take special interest
      in the local or regional weather events, yo are essentially engaging in weather
      as a hobby.
